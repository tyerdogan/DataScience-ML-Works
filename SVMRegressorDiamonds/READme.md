# SVM Regression on Diamonds Dataset 💎

This repository contains a machine learning notebook focused on **regression using Support Vector Machines (SVM)** applied to the well-known **Diamonds dataset**.

## Project Overview
The goal of this study is to predict the **price of diamonds** based on their physical and qualitative features using a **Support Vector Regressor (SVR)** model.

The notebook follows a standard end-to-end machine learning workflow:
- Data loading and inspection
- Data preprocessing and encoding
- Feature scaling
- Train–test split
- Model training with SVR
- Model evaluation using regression metrics


## Dataset
The **Diamonds dataset** includes features such as:
- Carat
- Cut
- Color
- Clarity
- Depth
- Table
- Dimensions (x, y, z)

Target variable:
- `price`

## Methods Used
- Categorical feature encoding
- Feature scaling (required for SVM-based models)
- Support Vector Regression (SVR)
- Model evaluation with:
  - R² score
  - MAE
  - RMSE

## Notes
- The notebook is shared for educational purposes.
- Feedback and suggestions for improvement are welcome.
