Iris Flower Classification

Project Overview

This project builds a Machine Learning classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers using the classic Iris Dataset. The main objective is to train and compare two baseline classification algorithms and evaluate which one performs better.

Dataset

The dataset includes measurements for three Iris species:
	•	Iris-setosa
	•	Iris-versicolor
	•	Iris-virginica

Features
	•	Sepal Length
	•	Sepal Width
	•	Petal Length
	•	Petal Width

Workflow

1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Visualized feature distributions using box plots
	•	Checked relationships between features using a correlation heatmap

Key insight: Petal Length and Petal Width show the strongest separation between species and appear to be the most informative features.

2) Data Preparation
	•	Verified there are no missing values
	•	Encoded target labels using Label Encoding
	•	Split the dataset into train/test sets
	•	Applied feature scaling to improve model performance and training stability

3) Modeling & Evaluation
Trained and compared two classic classifiers:
	•	Logistic Regression
	•	Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Model performance was evaluated on the test set to compare classification results.
